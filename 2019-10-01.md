# nix cache on google storage

Tweak and zimbatm released [a thin go proxy](https://github.com/tweag/nix-store-gcs-proxy) for writing and
reading a nix cache to GCS.

It's already packaged in 19.09 "loris" as `nix-store-gcs-proxy`. Note that it listens on `lo` by default so if you 
in kubernetes do sth like this:

```yaml
      containers:
      - name: nix-store-gcs-proxy
        image: eu.gcr.io/mm-boogle/nix-store-gcs-proxy:0.0.1
        command: ["/bin/nix-store-gcs-proxy"]
        args: [
          "--bucket-name", "mm-nix-cache",
          "--addr", "0.0.0.0:3000"
        ]
```
